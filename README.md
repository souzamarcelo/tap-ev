# TAP EV: Traffic Assignment Problem with Electric Vehicles

The Traffic Assignment Problem with Electric Vehicles (TAP-EV) considers that drivers of electric vehicles care about the travel time and energy consumption simultaneously. Therefore, the TAP-EV must address both objectives at the same time (a bi-objective problem). This repository contains the source code related to the TAP-EV, including:
+ Algorithms:
  + biobjective shortest path
  + biobjective successive averages (with greedy energy and greedy slope strategies)
+ Cost functions:
  + simple and detailed energy battery models
  + volume delay function
+ Some experiments

The following paper describes the proposed algorithms and the experimental results.
